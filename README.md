# FAHMR: Food Allergy & Health MR Workflow
FAHMR is an integrated analytical pipeline that combines the High-Definition Likelihood (HDL) framework with two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR). Leveraging large-scale GWAS summary statistics, this pipeline was developed to investigate the genetic correlations between polygenically predicted food allergy—particularly shrimp allergy—in East Asian populations and a broad spectrum of common human diseases. Moreover, FAHMR enables the assessment of the genetically predicted causal effects of food allergies on multiple disease outcomes.
